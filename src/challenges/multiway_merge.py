def multiway_merge(ordered_streams):

    Given m sorted streams, merge them to result in a new sorted stream containing
    all items in the given streams.

    Constraints:
        - The total number of items in all streams can be a huge number.
        - The algorithm supports online processing, i.e., not all data is available
        before the processing but they will come in time

    Computational complexity: O(n*log(m)), where n is the total number
    of items in all streams and m is the number of streams.
